# WASS
WASS is a web based appointment scheduling system. WASS allows people to create calendars on which they indicate their availability for appointments. People can then access those calendars and make appointments.  WASS includes an email notification and reminder facility, as well as iCal synchronization with local calendars (e.g., Outlook). WASS can be used by faculty and deans to schedule office hours or advising appointments. It can also be used to schedule tryouts.  Appointments or meetings with any person, place or thing which is available for limited periods of time can be scheduled through WASS. The system is entirely web-based.
